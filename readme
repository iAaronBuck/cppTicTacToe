This module produces a Command Line Interface TicTacToe game written in C++ in the 11th Standard. 

The only requirement in the project to run the project is typing "make run" into the command line
when inside of the folder for the repo. Additionally, the user must have downloaded and prepared
a local C++ development environment to execute the program.

This was an exploratory project meant to learn the basics of C++ along with providing 
a relatable teaching project to teach my 8 year-old nephew to code.
